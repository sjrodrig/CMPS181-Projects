PROJECT 2

Pair Programming:

All required functions were implemented. If you run into any errors, 
double check that the correct tables were initialized (for testing).

The scan free is data pointer when closed (close()), do NOT free them
yourself when testing or you will get a double free error.

reorganizePage() is currently not supported.
reorganizeFile() is currently not supported.

No known issues.  No unintended features.

Note that when inserting the data, put the length of the varchar 
at the front.
